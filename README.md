# Digital-Logic-Game
A simple gamified fork of Sebastian Lagues digital logic sim created as part of his video series: [Exploring How Computers Work](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0dPhqVsKt1Ni_46ARyiCGSq).

This is my first time using Unity so it may be a while before it works. The plan for this fork is that you would be given a truth table, and you'd need to replicate it using the blocks at your disposal, and possibly get a high score by using as few as possible.
